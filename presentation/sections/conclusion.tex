\section{Conclusion}
\begin{frame}{What did we do?}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Designed a neural network that solves our problem.
          \begin{itemize}
            \item Homomorphic encryption enables private inference.
            \item CKKS is inherently post-quantum secure.
          \end{itemize}
    \item Implemented a server in C++ with a frontend interface.
    \item Optimized using different matrix multiplication techniques and proved that they work.
    \item Compared results.
    \item Future Work: More Complicated Networks (CNNs, etc.).
