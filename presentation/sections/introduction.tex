\section{Introduction}
\begin{frame}{What do we want?}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Encrypted \gls{ml} as a service
    \item Using homomorphic encryption
    \item That is Post-Quantum secure
    \item Which is somewhat fast
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{What did I do?}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Fix stuff
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{\gls{ppml}}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Development of new applications and solutions 'of numerical nature' in different fields
          \begin{itemize}
            \item Example: Health Care with highly sensitive medical data.
            \item For instance, RNA sequences, images of skin, lab data, medical records, etc.
            \item The results are even more volatile: disease indicators.
          \end{itemize}
    \item $\Rightarrow$ Demand for privacy-preserving solutions in \gls{ml} applications.
    \item By the way: Post-Quantum Secure Cryptosystems!
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

      Quantum Computers affect Cryprography today:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Problems believed to be \glstext{np}-hard on classical computers can be computed in polynomial time using a quantum computer.
        \item No hardness proof of the integer factorisation or RSA problems exist as of today.
        \item \name{Shor}'s, \name{Grover}'s and other algorithms can 'break' many cryptographic schemes used today.
        \item The existence of a sufficiently powerful quantum computer endangers the security of \glstext{tls}, etc.
      \end{itemize}

  Our Webservice is (from the point of todays knowledge) still secure in the presence of a quantum computer.
