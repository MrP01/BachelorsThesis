\section{Step 3: Post-Quantum Security}
\begin{frame}{What about Long-Term Security?}
  Quantum Computers affect Cryprography today:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Problems believed to be \glstext{np}-hard on classical computers can be computed in polynomial time using a quantum computer.
    \item No hardness proofs of the RSA or integer factorisation problems exist.
    \item \name{Shor}'s, \name{Grover}'s and other algorithms can 'break' many cryptographic schemes used today.
    \item Existence of a powerful quantum computer endangers the security of \glstext{tls}, etc.
  \end{itemize}
  Microsoft SEAL is (from the point of todays knowledge) still secure in the presence of a quantum computer.
