\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{chap:conclusion}

In the present thesis, we explored the interesting realm of homomorphic encryption in a machine-learning context while considering various security aspects of it.
Next to the written part, the reader may find a server-client ('as a service') based demonstrator implementation of the homomorphically encrypted machine learning service for classifying handwritten digits, including a web-based frontend.

\section{Summary}
\Cref{chap:background} introduced mathematical preliminaries of the lattice-based homomorphic encryptions schemes used in \cref{chap:homomorphic-encryption}.
As the main focus lies on thoroughly understanding the notation used in the encryption schemes, we first concentrated on the algebraic ring $\Z_q[X]/(X^N+1)$ with coefficients modulo $q$ and the cyclotomic polynomial $(X^N+1)$ as its modulus.
Forming the basis of the upcoming cryptographic schemes, we introduced the \gls{lwe} problem and its descendant, \gls{rlwe}.
The multi-layered neural network is trained using the backpropagation algorithm of the Tensorflow library, an approach similar to gradient descent - which was all introduced in the next section of \cref{chap:background}.
The final \cref{sec:post-quantum-sec} introduced the reader to basic quantum mechanics and most of the necessary background to understand a simple quantum-mechanical system and the underlying principles of modern quantum computers.

\Cref{chap:homomorphic-encryption} starts out with one of the first homomorphic schemes there is, unpadded \gls{rsa}, motivating the need for a such structure.
The first \glsdesc{fhe} scheme, invented by Craig \name{Gentry} in his PhD thesis, strongly inspired further developments in the field:
Based on lattice problems and the \gls{rlwe} cryptosystem, \citeauthor{2012-brakerski,2012-fv-original} introduced the \gls{bfv} scheme for integer arithmetic.
Extending it, we arrived at \gls{ckks} scheme developed by \citeauthor{2017-ckks-original} with an extensive encoding and decoding procedure.
For both schemes, we verified the additive homomorphisms of the corresponding encryption (and encoding) operations \cryptop{BFV.Encrypt} and $\cryptop{CKKS.Encrypt} \circ \cryptop{CKKS.Encode}$.

\Cref{chap:implementation} then presents details about the implementation of the web-based demonstrator, concerning the deployment and software architectural specifics.
The main focus however lies on the technical challenges with \glsdesc{he} in practice.
Four different matrix multiplication techniques were introduced in detail, gradually increasing the complexity but also the efficiency.
The next challenge ahead was evaluating the activation function in between the two layers, due to technical reasons, only approximated by a series expansion.
\Cref{chap:results} presents the network's training results and a detailed statistical analysis of the network performance.
To explicitly show the 'garbling' property of the encryption, the first polynomial of the ciphertext is visualised for a few test samples (\cref{fig:ciphertext-visualisation}).
Finally, we analysed the runtime, network communication and numerical performance of the algorithms for different parameters, summarised in \cref{tab:performance-benchmarks}.

Two longer proofs were outhoused to the \Cref{chap:appendix}, one on the power-of-2 cyclotomic polynomials and a second one on the \gls{bsgs} matrix multiplication method.

\section{Outlook}
\todo{To be written: describe existing solutions, approaches, current research, etc.}
% describe existing solutions, approaches, current research, etc.
% -> list the papers in library/ folder?
% (include Fabians master thesis about splitting Relin, Galois keys using SPDZ
% to support multiple data providers (clients) and one server, using normal HE algorithms)

Considering the implications of mass surveilance, the importance of privacy-preserving/enhancing technologies should not be forgotten.
